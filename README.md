# ECE4760 Web Demo
- ðŸ‘‰ [Click here to play the game on GitHub Pages](https://cmdhl.github.io/ece4760-web-demo/)
- A computer version of our ECE4760 final project on pico, by Albert Sun (ays48), Edwin Dake(ed433), and Zoey Mo (zm73).
- The conversion from our [pico project](https://github.com/asun121/ece4760-final-project) to this web version is done by ChatGPT. 
- In our pico project, we used ECE4760's starter code from [Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos](https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos)
- We referenced the art style and animations of [Footsies](https://github.com/hifight/Footsies) by drawing our characters on top of their spritesheets.
